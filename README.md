# ThumbsUp! Trackball v3

A PCB-based thumb-operated trackball, inspired by Elecom EX-G left hand trackball, Ploopy Nano trackball, and my own ThumbsUp! keyboards.

To be suitable for both left- and right-hand usage (in "portrairt" orientation), and also be finger-operated (in "landscape").
A three-position switch/soldering pad tells the device which mode to use - that will define the rotating direction.

It is a continuation of Trackball v2 - with the switches moved around, top board rotation eliminated, and some other minor changes.
 
Off-the-shelf ProMicro-style MCUs are considered: 
- Atmega- or RP2040-driven with QMK-based firmware - wired.
- nice!nano v2 (and clones) with ZMK-based firmware - wireless.

34 mm ball, same as in Elecom EX-G.
For bearings - uxcell 2.5mm Ceramic Bearing Balls, ZrO2 Zirconium Oxide Ball, again, the same as used to improve my Elecom trackballs.
Bearings to be implanted into PCBs, no 3D-printed ball shroud/holder.
